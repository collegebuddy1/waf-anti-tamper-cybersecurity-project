                         Anti-tamper

  What is it?
  -----------
  Anti-tamper is an important function of FreeWAF software. 
  It's a supplement of protection engine. The protection 
  engine of FreeWAF cannot supply 100% security protection.
  Once high-level hacker bypasses the FreeWaf protection and 
  tampers you website, then you need to recover your website 
  as soon as possible. If the site has not been resumed as 
  soon as possible, the tampered web pages may be exposed 
  over a long period of time, and cause bad effects. Anti-tamper
  can slove this problem.
